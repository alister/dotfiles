## petrified configuration file
#
# This is the configuration for petrified - a client for updaing dynamic
# DNS at freedns.afraid.org. The global /etc/petrified.conf variables can
# be overridden on a per-user basis via ~/.petrifiedrc as well.
#
# Passing '-c <config>' on the commandline will read *only* the named
# config file, ignoring /etc/petrified.conf and ~/.petrifiedrc entirely.
# For best security of the DDNS_KEY, ensure the config file is mode 0600
# and owned by the user in question.
#
# See petrified.crontab for examples on how to run via cron/fcron.


# This is the unique string for the dynamic DNS entry to update; visit
# http://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/ - next to the DNS entries towards
# the bottom is a link "Direct URL"; copy that and extract the string
# after the '...update.php?' part and put here.
#
# Example: DDNS_KEY=9C4yjq3kaekkYNbYsKRqcosTmouMYbfVMLkJtR==
DDNS_KEY=UVozUm1PNXVTOFd0SVpFOXg3cjVqampZOjc4NTI0Mzk=
